# Installation

Run the install script to backup existing config files and link the new ones.
The `.gitconfig` file is copied rather than linked since it is likely to contain tokens and other private information

# Other Notable Downloads

* Mac: Install and use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) rather than MacPorts or Fink
* Use [git bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion)
